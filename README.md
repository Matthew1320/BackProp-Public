# BackProp-Public

In this project, I implemented and tested a simple backprop engine. The backprop engine I implemented differs from more sophisticated machine learning systems, such as PyTorch, in that it uses a simple object oriented structure (rather than the more functional approach that is typical of modern ML systems). This made it easier to understand how control flow works within the backprop algorithm. The first part of the project was implementing backprop for scalars and then later on, I expanded my implementation to work on more general arrays. To test the correctness of the automatic differentiation and to compare the efficiencies and accuracies of the different methods, I implemented a symbolic derivative implementation and a numerical derivative output and compared the outputs of each.
